# TinyLegend

This is a small game engine I've been working on for fun
This only works on windows using command prompt. 
You'll need visual studio to read and compile the code

Heres a list of functions and structs you can use using the engine namespace:

structures:
	vector2i,
	Image (defined in int matrixes),
	Objects:
		Empty:
			Display,
		Static,
		Dynamic,
		Entity,
	Map,
	Game,

functions:
	draw_screen,
	draw_UI,
	calculateMovement,
	colour,
	colour_bg,
	debug,
